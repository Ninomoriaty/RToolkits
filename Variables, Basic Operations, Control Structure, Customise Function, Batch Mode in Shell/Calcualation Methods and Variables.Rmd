**Commands**: 
```{r}
# How to configure the startup environment
help(Startup) 

# get environemnt variable information
## Tips: Sys is not the same as sys
Sys.getenv() # List all environment variables
Sys.getenv("R_HOME") # The environment variable containing the home directory of the R environment/pathway.
Sys.getenv("HOME") # The settled workspace environment variable for R project

# Execute before or after the R session 
.First() # load pkgs that you commonly used
.Last() # provide any cleanup activities, including archiving command histories, program output, and data files

# set R options

# specify a working directory

# load commonly used packages

# load user-written functions

# set a default CRAN download site

# others


```



# Manage your packages
```{r}
# library
libPaths() # figure out the dir where stores packages
library() # show the package lists in diffferent dirs
library(rmarkdown) # load particular packages

# list packages
search() # lists packages are loaded and ready to use.
installed.packages() # list the packages you have, along with their version numbers, dependencies, and other information.

# install packages 
install.packages() # show the CRAN mirror sites.
install.packages("package_names")

# update packages
# Tips: it would be better to use a pkg management system to update pkgs.
update.packages() # update all pkgs
 

```



# Manage the Workspace and Working Directory
```{r}
# Get the current working directory
getwd()

# create a directory
dir.create(path = "pathname")

# set the current working directory
setwd("mydirectory") # Tips: The dir should be already existing.

# Lists the objects in the current workspace.
ls() 

# Removes (deletes) one or more objects.
rm(objectlist) 

# Lets you view or set current options.
options()
options(digits = 3) # set the digits after the decimal place

# Displays your last n commands (default = 25).
history(n) 
savehistory("comnand_history_file") # Saves the commands history to myfile (default = .Rhistory).
loadhistory("comnand_history_file") # Reloads a command’s history (default = .Rhistory).

# Save the Workspace
save.image("my_workspace_file") # Saves the workspace to my_workspace_file (default = .RData).
save(objectlist, file="my_workspace_file") # Saves specific objects to a file.
load("my_workspace_file") # Load a workspace into the current session.
q() # Quits R. You’ll be prompted to save the workspace.

# Mathematical operations and variables
```{r}
# most basic four operators
1+1.5
1-1.5
1*2
16/7

# cal-related functions
ages <- c(1,2,3,4,4,5,6)
sum(ages)
mean(ages)
sd(ages) # standard error

max(ages)
min(ages)
range(ages)

sort(ages)
unique(ages)

2*sqrt(2) # Attention: not Julia scientific expression however a more statistic way

# sumarise some statistics results: min, 1st quantifile, median, mean, 3rd quantifile, max
summary(object = obj1)





```


# Variable Assignment
```{r}
# Assign a value
i <- 0 # general

# in loops
upToTen <- function(x){ # temp var
  for (x in c(0,10)){
  y <- x+1
  }
  print(y)
}

upToTen(i) # use the actual var to process the function

# Delete a variable
remove(i)
rm(i)
```


# Control Structure
## `for` loops


# Define Functions and Customisation



# Other Tips and Details about R Programming
1. By convention, script filenames end with an .R extension, but this isn’t required.


# Batch Mode in Shell
Tips: More details: "Appendix B: Invoking R" chapter in the book "Introduction to R" in https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html
```{bash}
R CMD BATCH options infile outfile
```
